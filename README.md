# Todolist


This application is a todo list, used for keeping track of deadlines for tasks. Users can add new tasks to the to-do 
list, cross off finished tasks, and delete tasks. As well as view the list of tasks and the number of tasks in total. 

This application is designed for anyone who needs an app to keep track of deadlines and due dates that needs to be 
remembered. I want to write this project because it could be useful in daily lives, to help users get 
more organized.

####Phase 4: Task 3
If I have more time, I will try to refactor the code for json writer and reader, because everytime it is called, 
it takes many lines for it to function properly. I will try to refactor those lines of code so that it can be called in
one line. Another point is that I would combine the main menu and the list graphics options into one
window and display the list as a seperate window. This way the main menu will make more sense as there are more options 
to select from, and the list will be rendered at the side when needed, not all the time.
